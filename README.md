Short Summary About Me
I am a passionate and detail-oriented Computer Science student at the University of the South Pacific with a strong foundation in software engineering, cybersecurity, and network systems. I have developed a range of practical applications, including a real-time Python-based tutor-student attendance system using sockets and Tkinter, a secure student attendance management system with Spring Boot, and a personal portfolio website to showcase my projects.

I specialize in Java, Spring Boot, Python, and front-end development using HTML and CSS (without JavaScript), and I have experience integrating MySQL databases via XAMPP. I have also explored complex algorithmic challenges such as the N-Queens problem and implemented polymorphic sorting techniques. My work emphasizes user authentication, role-based access control, secure data handling, and compliance with privacy standards.

Iâ€™m constantly expanding my skills by analyzing real-world cybersecurity events, such as the UnitedHealth Group data breach, and applying risk assessment frameworks in my reports and projects. I thrive in solving real problems through clean code, thoughtful architecture, and a strong sense of responsibility for data integrity and user experience.
